# Laravel 12 Route Issue Resolution Guide

This document provides steps to resolve the "Method Not Allowed" error you're experiencing with your Laravel 12 application.

## The Issue

```
Symfony\Component\HttpKernel\Exception\MethodNotAllowedHttpException
The GET method is not supported for route /. Supported methods: HEAD.
```

## Quick Resolution Steps

1. **Run the troubleshooting script**

   ```bash
   cd /Users/mdenitti/Downloads/fullstack/actions
   ./fix-route-issue.sh
   ```

2. **If the script doesn't fix the issue, try these manual steps:**

   a. **Clear all caches:**
   ```bash
   php artisan cache:clear
   php artisan config:clear
   php artisan route:clear
   php artisan view:clear
   php artisan optimize:clear
   ```

   b. **Check and fix route definitions in web.php:**
   Make sure your route definition is correct in `routes/web.php`. Try adding an explicit return type:
   
   ```php
   Route::get('/', function () {
       return view('welcome');
   })->name('welcome');
   ```

   c. **Check middleware:**
   Make sure no middleware is interfering with your routes. Check:
   - `app/Http/Kernel.php` for any custom middleware
   - `app/Providers/RouteServiceProvider.php` for route modifications

   d. **Fix potential permissions issues:**
   ```bash
   chmod -R 775 storage bootstrap/cache
   chmod -R 775 public
   ```

   e. **Verify web server configuration:**
   Make sure your web server (Apache/Nginx) is correctly configured with proper rewrite rules.

   f. **Try a different test route:**
   Add a simple test route to verify the routing system:
   
   ```php
   Route::get('/test', function() {
       return 'Route working!';
   });
   ```

3. **Last resort options:**

   a. **Reinstall Laravel's core dependencies:**
   ```bash
   composer update symfony/http-kernel --with-all-dependencies
   ```

   b. **Check your server environment:**
   - Verify PHP version compatibility
   - Check for any server-side URL rewriting that might affect routing

## Prevention for Future Deployments

The updated `post-deploy.sh` script now includes comprehensive cache clearing, permission setting, and route verification that should prevent this issue in the future.

If these steps don't resolve the issue, further server-level investigation may be needed.
